# Recursion

Using your notes (and the [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12YeS_P_tVBnPn0KBtXZNWujoCCnGuY1Vlc-CZGv4Iao/edit?usp=sharing)) please attempt the tasks in the PDF *recursion_practice* in this repo. 

Yes, I know that most can be done easily, perhaps even with built-in functions, but that's not the point: **ALL** your functions should be recursive, _not_ iterative _nor_ using built-in functions.
